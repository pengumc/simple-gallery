simple-gallery

-- Basic workings:
* gallery2.php is the main page. It scans ./ for directories that contain a .gallery file and lists those directories as gallery names.

* grab_photos.php returns html that contains foto sections for all <name>.jpg files in the gallery directory that also have a <name>_thumb.jpg file.
any <name>.txt file is regarded to be a caption and is added to the foto

* upload/upload.py handles two types of uploads. First there are single .jpg files, these are stored in ./ (default setting).
secondly, there are zip files that contain a set of jpg's and *no* directories. If the zipfile is accepted, a new gallery is created with the name of the zipfile, containing all the fotos.



-- setup:
* the following files need to be executable by the webserver:
 grab_photos.php
 upload/upload.py
 upload/thumb.php

* ./ and ./upload need to be writeable by upload.py



-- configuration:
* some stuff in the first lines of upload.py
* gallery2.js current_gallery is a string containing the default gallery
(the one that's opened if you open galery2.php instead of gallery2.php#<galleryname>)
